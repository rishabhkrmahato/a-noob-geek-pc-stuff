3D printing, or additive manufacturing, creates three-dimensional objects by layering material based on digital designs.

**What It Does:**
It enables the production of complex shapes and customized items, from prototypes to functional parts, across various industries.

**Cost:**
Entry-level 3D printers in India range from ₹20,000 to ₹50,000. Filament spools (the printing material) cost between ₹1,000 and ₹3,000 per kilogram, depending on the type.

**Requirements:**
- **Hardware:** A 3D printer.
- **Software:** 3D modeling software and slicer software to prepare designs for printing.
- **Materials:** Filaments like PLA or ABS.

**How to Use:**
1. **Design/Create:** Use 3D modeling software to create or modify a design.
2. **Slice:** Process the design with slicer software to generate instructions for the printer.
3. **Print:** Load the filament, set up the printer, and start printing.

**Creating a 3D Model:**
Design models using software like Tinkercad (user-friendly) or Blender (more advanced).

**Obtaining 3D Models:**
Download models from repositories like Thingiverse or MyMiniFactory.

**Trusted Free/Open-Source 3D Model Files:**
- **Thingiverse:** A vast collection of user-uploaded designs.
- **MyMiniFactory:** Curated, high-quality models.

**Value vs. Investment:**
3D printing is valuable for rapid prototyping, custom parts, and educational purposes, offering returns that can justify the initial investment.

**Recommended Software:**
- **Free/Open-Source:** Blender (modeling), Ultimaker Cura (slicing).
- **Paid:** AutoCAD, Simplify3D.

**Maintenance Costs:**
Regular expenses include filament replenishment and occasional part replacements, typically amounting to a few thousand rupees annually.

**Filaments:**
These are thermoplastic materials used by 3D printers to create objects. Common types include PLA (easy to use) and ABS (more durable).

**Filament Prices:**
In India, filament prices range from ₹1,000 to ₹3,000 per kilogram, varying by material and brand.

**Availability in India:**
3D printers and filaments are readily available through online retailers and specialized stores.

**Good Starter 3D Printers:**
- **Creality Ender 3:** Affordable and widely recommended for beginners.
- **Anycubic i3 Mega:** User-friendly with good print quality.

Both models are available in India and offer a balance between cost and functionality. 

The number of 3D models you can make with 1 kg of filament depends on the size, infill percentage, and complexity of the models. Here's a rough estimate:

1. **Small Objects (e.g., keychains, small figurines):**  
   - Weight: ~10-50 grams per model.  
   - Output: ~20-100 models.  

2. **Medium-Sized Objects (e.g., phone stands, mugs):**  
   - Weight: ~100-200 grams per model.  
   - Output: ~5-10 models.  

3. **Large Objects (e.g., helmets, large figurines):**  
   - Weight: ~500-700 grams per model.  
   - Output: ~1-2 models.  

**Example:**  
A typical Benchy boat (test print) uses about 15-25 grams of filament, meaning you could print around **40-60 Benchy boats** from 1 kg.  

Factors like **print settings (e.g., infill density, layer height)** and **support material usage** affect these numbers.
