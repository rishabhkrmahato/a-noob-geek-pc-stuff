1. nano editor (awesome , just edit in cli only)

eg. 
type nul > test.bat
nano test.bat 
code and save and exit 
continue in CLI

2. colorls (best way to list files in the directory)
better than eza (exa fork) or ls (default Linux)

install it via ruby (get ruby via choco)
ridk install
gem install colorls

using ll.bat in system32 having colorls -la %* command 
just type ll in cli and have your colourful listed files with all details. (better but a bit slower)
or you can use doskey and autorun a alias-list.cmd everytime (nerdy complicated way)
