Set Windows Console Host as Default and Configure CMD Appearance

Step 1: Set Default Terminal Application
1. Open Windows Terminal.
2. Set the default terminal application to Windows Console Host.
   (Windows Terminal lacks an option to disable text wrapping, which can be frustrating to work with.)

Step 2: Open CMD
1. Search for cmd and open it.
2. Right-click the title bar → Click "Defaults"

Step 3: Configure CMD Settings

- Options Tab:
  - Leave everything as is.

- Font Tab:
  - Font size: 22
  - Font: Cascadia Code

- Layout Tab:
  - Uncheck "Wrap text output on resize"
  - Set Screen Buffer Size: 200 x 9001 (Width × Height)
  - Set Window Size: 120 × 30 (Width × Height)
  - Check "Let system position window"

- Colors Tab:
  - Screen Text: (255, 255, 255) [White]
  - Screen Background: (0, 0, 0) [Black]
  - Popup Text: (0, 0, 255) [Blue]
  - Popup Background: (250, 250, 50) [Yellowish]
  - Opacity: 98%
    - (Opacity adjustment has multiple steps per value, meaning 99% has three sub-levels of opacity control, and other values may also behave similarly.)

- Terminal Tab:
  - Ensure Windows Console Host is set as the default terminal application.
  - Enable "Cursor color" and set it to (0, 255, 0) [Green].

Step 4: Apply & Exit
Click OK and close the window.

Effect of These Changes:
- These settings apply universally across Windows for all console pop-ups, whether from a script or manually opened, admin or non-admin.
- If you notice variations in a specific console window, adjust the settings via "Right-click title bar → Properties" for that instance.
- Applies to CMD, PowerShell, PowerShell Core, WSL (Ubuntu, etc.) in both admin and non-admin sessions.
