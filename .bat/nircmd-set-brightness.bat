:: to accept only numbers between 0 and 100.
::
:: Key Features:
:: - Checks if NirCMD is available before running.
:: - Prompts the user to enter a brightness level (0-100).
:: - Validates user input to prevent incorrect values.
:: - Adjusts the screen brightness using `nircmd.exe setbrightness`.
:: - Allows the user to adjust brightness again or exit.
::
:: Hard-Coded Details:
:: - Assumes `nircmd.exe` is installed in `C:\Windows\System32` or the scriptâ€™s directory.
::
:: Steps to Update Hard-Coded Details:
:: 1. Ensure `nircmd.exe` is installed and accessible from the system PATH.
:: 2. Modify input validation rules if different constraints are needed.
::
:: Usage:
:: - Run the script and enter a brightness level (0-100).
:: - The script applies the brightness setting and provides an option to adjust again or exit.
::
:: Dependencies:
:: - NirCMD (`nircmd.exe`) must be installed and accessible.
::
:: Output:
:: - Displays confirmation when brightness is adjusted.
:: - Provides an option to re-adjust or exit after applying brightness.
::
:: Error Handling:
:: - Displays an error if NirCMD is not found.
:: - Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted (0-100 range).
::
:: Notes:
:: - This script modifies brightness settings, which may not work on all devices 
::   without proper driver support.
