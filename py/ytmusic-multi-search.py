Description:

YouTube Music Multi-Search Script

This Python script automates opening multiple YouTube Music search tabs in 
Google Chrome for a list of user-provided songs. It helps streamline searching 
for songs by generating YouTube Music search URLs and opening them as browser tabs.

Key Features:
- Prompts the user to input song names, one per line.
- Opens a new Google Chrome window for searches (configurable).
- Generates YouTube Music search URLs for each song.
- Opens each search in a new tab with a delay to avoid overload.

Usage:
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter song names one by one when prompted, and type 'done' to finish.
3. The script opens a new Chrome window and searches for each song in a separate tab.

Configurations:
- `BASE_URL`: Base URL for YouTube Music searches (default: "https://music.youtube.com/search?q=").
- `CHROME_PATH`: Command to launch Chrome (default: "start chrome"). Update if the path is non-standard.
- `NEW_WINDOW_FLAG`: Chrome flag to open a new window (default: opens Google search).
- `TAB_DELAY`: Delay (in seconds) between opening each tab (default: 2 seconds).

Steps to Update Hard-Coded Details:
1. Update `CHROME_PATH` to match your system's Chrome path, if necessary.
2. Modify `NEW_WINDOW_FLAG` to change the default behavior for opening a new Chrome window.
3. Adjust `TAB_DELAY` to control the delay between opening tabs.

Output:
- Opens a new Chrome window with YouTube Music search tabs for each entered song.

Error Handling:
- Logs any errors encountered when opening the browser or tabs.
- Exits gracefully if the user cancels the script or an unexpected error occurs.

Notes:
- Ensure Google Chrome is installed and added to the system PATH.
- Internet connectivity is required to open YouTube Music tabs.
